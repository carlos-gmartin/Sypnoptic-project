                <h5>Purse Seine</h5>
            <p>A boat locates a school of fish, then, using a small boat, 
                the school of fish is surrounded by a net. 
                Then they are pulled aboard with the fish inside. Purse 
                seining only targets a particular school of fish after it has 
                been located, so  bycatch is extremely low. Because of this 
                fisherman will deploy Fish aggregating devices(FADs).
                They can make seining much easier by reducing fuel 
                use and time spent looking for schools of fish. FADs also attract 
                other marine life and increase bycatch</p>

            <h5>Bottom trawl</h5>
            <p>
                Bottom trawls involve dragging a weighted net across the bottom to scoop up fish. The effect 
                of bottom thrawl varies depending on the type of sea bed. Sandy and rock sea beds are not strongly
                effected as they can renegrate very quickely but sensitive habitats like deepwater coral or sponge gardens
                are negativly impacted by a bottom thrawl.

                <h5>Midwater trawl</h5>
            <p>
                Midwater trawls pull a net through the mid- and surface water. To make mid water fishing easier 
                acoustic techonology is used to locat the positon of the fish in accordance to the path of the boat.

            <h5>Gillnet</h5>
            <p>Gillnets are a wall of nets that hangs vertically in the sea. 
                Fish unknowingly swim into it and get stuck. Gillnets are commonly used in 
                poorer countries as they dont require a boat with big engine to fish. Also gillnets have the
                most bycatch of any fishing methods.

            <h5>Longlines</h5>
            <p>Longlines constsist of fishing line that are miles long behind a boat. It can be used when fishing at the bottom
                or mid water of the sea. If this type of fishing is not managed properly it can effect non traget fish and birds
                so fisherman using this techniques often use weighted long lines to allow it sink quicker.

            <h5>Pole and line</h5>
            <p>A school of fish is first located and then fish bait is thrown. This trickes fishes into biting anything
                they see and at this ponit pole and line fishing is used to catch fish indiviadually. 
                There is no concern over bycatch as only the target fish is effected.

          <h5>Dredge</h5>
            <p>
            In dredge a meral rake is dragged across the ocean floar to harvest bivalves such as scallops, oysters and clams.
            The enviromental inmpact of dredgeing can vary greatly depending on the type of ocean floar- 
            sensetive regions of the ocean floar like deepwater coral or sponge gardens are strongly negativly effected.

            <h5>Traps and Pots</h5>
            <p>Traps and pots are set at the bottom of the ocean and invertebrates crawl inside 
                they canâ€™t escape and are pulled back to the surface when the fisherman returns. 
                They generaly have low impact on the enviroment and the seabed but it is possible 
                for the traps and pots to be swept away by the currents or fisher have just forgotten 
                where they have set their traps. These incidents haveled to whale intanglement.
